Calls made to lua
*****************
These are functions the game calls in the gameplay lua script so they need to be defined in there. The reason for having these is mostly for updating and starting animations.

update_score(newScore)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For updating the score in lua.

update_combo(newCombo)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For updating the combo in lua.

near_hit(wasLate)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For updating early/late display.

button_hit(button, rating, delta)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Can be used for a number of things, such as starting custom hit animations or more advanced early/late displays.
``button`` uses the same values as the ``game.BUTTON_*`` values.
``delta`` is the hit time from perfect, positive values = late, negative values = early.

``rating`` is the hit rating and the values are:

.. code-block:: c

    0 = Miss
    1 = Near
    2 = Crit
    3 = Idle

Idle and Miss are special cases that do not have any delta (delta always 0). Idle is triggered when the player
hits the button when there is no note object in range on that lane.

laser_slam_hit(slamLength, startPos, endPost, index)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For animating laser slam hits.
``slamLength`` is the length between slams from -2.0 through 2.0. The sign on this value indicates the slam direction.
``startPos`` is the x offset from the center of the crit line where the slam starts
``endPos`` is the x offset from the center of the crit line where the slam ends
``index`` indicates which laser the slam was for

laser_alert(isRight)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For starting laser alert animations::

    if isRight == true then restart right alert animation
    else restart left alert animation
    
render(deltaTime)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The GUI render call. This is called last and will draw over everything else.
    
render_crit_base(deltaTime)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Function to render the base of the critical line. This function will be called
after rendering the highway and playable objects, but before the built-in particle
effects. Use this to draw the critical line itself as well as the darkening effects
placed over the playable objects.

See the default skin for an example.
    
render_crit_overlay(deltaTime)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Function to render the rest of the critical line, this is the last thing to be called
before ``render`` so anything else which belongs above the built-in particle effects goes here.
This is the place to draw the laser cursors.

See the default skin for an example.
    
render_intro(deltaTime)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Function for rendering an intro or keeping an intro timer. This function will be
called every frame until it returns ``true`` and never again after it has.

Example:

.. code-block:: lua

    render_intro = function(deltaTime)
        if not game.GetButton(game.BUTTON_STA) then
            introTimer = introTimer - deltaTime
        end
        introTimer = math.max(introTimer, 0)
        return introTimer <= 0
    end

render_outro(deltaTime, clearState)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Function for rendering an outro or keeping an outro timer.

This function can return two values, the first being a boolean to tell the game
when the outro has completed and the second must be a number that sets the playback
speed, like so:

.. code-block:: lua
    
    local outroTimer = 0
    --Slows the playback to a stop for the first second
    --and then goes to the result screen after another second
    render_outro = function(deltaTime, clearState)
        outroTimer = outroTimer + deltaTime --counts timer up
        return outroTimer > 2, 1 - outroTimer
    end


This function gets called when the game has ended till the game has transitioned into
the result screen, the game starts transitioning when this function returns ``true``
for the first time.

``clearState`` tells this function if the player failed or cleared the game for example.
These are all the possible states::

    0 = Player manually exited the game
    1 = Failed
    2 = Cleared
    3 = Hard Cleared
    4 = Full Combo
    5 = Perfect

practice_start(mission_type, mission_threshold, mission_description)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(Practice mode only) This is called when the practice is being started.
``mission_type`` is the current mission type (one of None, Score, Grade, Miss, MissAndNear, and Gauge).
``mission_threshold`` is the parameter value for the current mission.
``mission_description`` is a textual description for the current mission, and is suitable for displaying.

practice_end_run(playCount, successCount, isSuccessful, scoring)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(Practice mode only) This is called when a run ("one loop") is finished.
``playCount``, ``successCount``, ``isSuccessful`` are self-explationary.
``scoring`` is a table containing informations on the current run with the following fields.

.. code-block:: c

    int score
    int perfects
    int goods
    int misses
    int medianHitDelta
    int meanHitDelta
    int medianHitDeltaAbs
    int meanHitDeltaAbs

``score`` changes depending on current score display setting.

practice_end(playCount, successCount)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(Practice mode only) This is called when the practice setup is entered again after practicing.
